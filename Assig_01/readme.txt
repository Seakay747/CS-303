Using the program should be straight forward given the implemented menu
Enter the command you wish to use in the window and any additional values prompted
Most to all error handeling is done by the program with one exception; numbers outside of the range -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 CANNOT be added to the number library
The program is only allocating 4 bytes of memory per integer value and is not prepared to handle integers that cannot be stored in those bytes

UPDATE: I couldn't get the output image in the readme so they can be observed in the Wiki Pages or Opened Directly (they are the ouput pngs)
